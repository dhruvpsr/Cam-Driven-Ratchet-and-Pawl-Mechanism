# Cam-Driven Ratchet and Pawl Mechanism

## Overview
This project explores the **Cam-Driven Ratchet and Pawl Mechanism**, a widely used mechanical system that converts continuous motion into controlled, incremental movement. The mechanism is commonly found in **clocks, lifting devices, indexing tables, and mechanical counters**.

## Features
- Converts continuous rotary motion into stepwise motion.
- Prevents backward movement using a **pawl-locking system**.
- Works without electrical power, making it ideal for **manual, gravity, or air-driven systems**.
- Utilizes **recycled materials** for sustainable design.

## Working Principle
- A **cam** rotates and applies force to a **follower**.
- The **follower** engages a **pawl**, which locks onto a **ratchet wheel**.
- Each cam rotation moves the **ratchet incrementally**, ensuring controlled movement.
- The **pawl** prevents backward slipping.

## Engineering Analysis
- **Static Force Analysis:** Calculates forces acting on the system.
- **Kinematic Analysis:** Determines velocity and motion characteristics.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Examines torque, inertia, and system stability.

## Applications
- **Clocks & Watches:** Ensures precise movement of gears.
- **Lifting Mechanisms:** Maintains load position in manual lifting devices.
- **Manufacturing Indexing Tables:** Positions items for machining or assembly.
- **Mechanical Counters:** Tracks machine cycles or repetitive actions.

## Tools & Technologies
- **CAD Modeling:** SolidWorks
- **Engineering Analysis:** MATLAB
- **Material Selection:** Recycled metals & plastics

## Future Improvements
- Implementing **lubrication systems** for reduced friction and wear.
- Using **optimized cam profiles** for smoother motion.
- Enhancing **material durability** for high-load applications.
